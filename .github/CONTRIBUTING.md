## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` new feature
- `fix:` bug fix
- `docs:` documentation only changes
- `style:` changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor:` code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` code change that improves performance
- `test:` adding missing tests
- `chore:` changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

Examples:
```
feat: add user management command
fix: resolve ping command timeout issue
docs: update README installation guide
```

### TypeScript Styleguide

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by Biome)
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Prefer `const` over `let` where possible
- Use modern ES6+ features

### Code Structure

- Commands go in `src/commands/`
- Events go in `src/events/`
- Use the `@Declare` decorator for commands
- Use `createEvent` for events
- Export default the command/event class/function

### Example Command

```typescript
import { Command, type CommandContext, Declare } from "seyfert";

@Declare({
    name: "example",
    description: "An example command",
})
export default class ExampleCommand extends Command {
    override async run(ctx: CommandContext) {
        await ctx.reply({ content: "Hello, world!" });
    }
}
```

### Example Event

```typescript
import { createEvent } from "seyfert";

export default createEvent({
    data: { name: "messageCreate" },
    async run(message, client) {
        // Handle the event
    },
});
```

## Testing

- Test your changes thoroughly before submitting
- Ensure all existing functionality still works
- Add tests for new features when possible
- Test with different Discord servers and permissions

## Documentation

- Add JSDoc comments for new public APIs
- Update configuration documentation if needed
